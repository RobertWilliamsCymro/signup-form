# Session 2
# 1 - Fix Backgroundimage issue
# 2 - 
# session started - 16:20
# sesson ended - 17:01
# Notes - Finally solved the background image problem, for some reason, next sees it as a module when loaded via tailwind, had to create a custom class to get around it, need to look more into why this is the case. Tailwind doesn't play well with using custom classes in media queries e.g. sm:custom-class, got it working in the end and got rid of the custom classes, when it was in the public folder, the images worked as intended. useful link: https://redpixelthemes.com/blog/tailwindcss-background-image/
